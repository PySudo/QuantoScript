# DataTypes

## integer
- Create a variable with value 10 :
```
myInt = 10
```

## string
- Syntax
```
'its a string'
```
if you want to use single quote in strings just put it in string , don't need to use \ in string , for example :
```
myString = 'i use ' in string.'
```
now `myString` have this value : "i use ' in string."

## list
- Currently, it does not support nested lists.
- Syntax
```
[element1, element2, ...]
```
- Create a variable with 2 element :
```
myList = ['Hello world', 10]
```

# variables
- You can store any data type in a variable.
- You can't use "_" as start of a variable name.

## Syntax :
```
var_name = dataType
```

- DEFINE variables :
```
VAR = 'This is a DEFINE variable'
```
You should to write all variable letters in capital letters for DEFINE.

# comments
- for comments you can use `#` (optional).
 for example :

```
VAR = 'This is a string' # This is a DEFINE variable
myString = 'This is a changable variable.'

This is a comment.
But its better to use "#" for comments...
```
if you want to set comment to a empty line that optional to use `#`. for example :
```
This is a comment
```
and
```
# This is a comment
```
these same , but if you want to set a comment in a variable line or... you should to use `#` like this :
```
myVar = 'i have a comment in this line' # This is a comment
```
But you can't use comments like this :
```
myVar = 'i have a comment in this line' This is a comment
```

## usage
```bash
ruby qs FILE.qs
```
